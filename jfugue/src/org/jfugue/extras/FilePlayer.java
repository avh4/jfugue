/**
 * Plays music strings from a text file.
 *
 * <p>
 * Here's a sample file:
 *<font color="blue"><pre>
 * #
 * # "Inventio 13" - Beethoven   (First Measure)
 * #
 *
 * V1 T160
 * V1 Rs  E4s A4s C5s B4s E4s B4s D5s C5i      E5i     G#4i    E5i
 * V2 A2i     A3q             G#3i    A3s G#3s A3s C4s B3s E3s B3s D4s
 *</pre></font>
 *</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note the use of # as a comment character when used as the first character of a line.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To use FilePlayer, enter "<i>java org.jfugue.FilePlayer input-filename [output-filename]</i>" from the
 * command prompt, where <i>input-filename</i> is the name of your text file that specifies
 * the music, and <i>output-filename</i> is the name of the MIDI file to create.  (If you
 * don't give <i>output-filename</i>, it will default to player.mid)
 * </p>
